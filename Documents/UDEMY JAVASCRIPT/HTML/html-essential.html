      As of 2023, the global chicken population exceeds 26.5 billion, with more
      than 50 billion birds produced annually for consumption. Specialized
      breeds such as broilers and laying hens have been developed for meat and
      egg production, respectively.

    <h2>Reproduction</h2>
    <p>
      To initiate courting, some roosters may dance in a circle around or near a
      hen (a circle dance), often lowering the wing which is closest to the
      hen.[36] The dance triggers a response in the hen[36] and when she
      responds to his call, the rooster may mount the hen and proceed with the
      mating.

      copulation the male does a tail-bending display
